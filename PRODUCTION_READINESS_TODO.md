# Production Readiness TODO - UpGr8 Platform

**CRITICAL:** This application has serious security vulnerabilities that must be fixed before production deployment.

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES - FIX IMMEDIATELY (Priority 1)

### Security Vulnerabilities

- [ ] **URGENT: Rotate Supabase credentials** - Production keys exposed in `.env.local`
  - [ ] Generate new Supabase project keys
  - [ ] Update environment variables in production
  - [ ] Remove `.env.local` from repository history (`git filter-branch` or BFG)
  - [ ] Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (if not already present)

- [ ] **Implement authentication middleware** 
  - [ ] Create `middleware.ts` in project root
  - [ ] Protect all `/coach-dashboard/*` routes
  - [ ] Add server-side auth validation before page rendering
  - [ ] Redirect unauthenticated users to login

- [ ] **Fix authorization bypass vulnerabilities**
  - [ ] Add `coach_id` filtering to ALL database queries in:
    - [ ] `/src/app/coach-dashboard/regular-season/team/[teamId]/page.tsx` (lines 70-75, 88-94, 105-111)
    - [ ] Team management components
    - [ ] Player management components
    - [ ] Evaluation components
  - [ ] Implement server-side permission checks
  - [ ] Add role-based access control

- [ ] **Secure file upload system**
  - [ ] Add file size limits (max 10MB) in `/src/components/players/BulkImportModal.tsx`
  - [ ] Implement content validation (not just extension check)
  - [ ] Add virus scanning if possible
  - [ ] Implement file streaming instead of loading entire file in memory
  - [ ] Validate CSV structure before processing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUES (Priority 2 - 24-48 hours)

### Database Security & Integrity

- [ ] **Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities**
  - [ ] Review and sanitize user input in `/src/app/api/waiting-list/route.ts` (lines 27-31)
  - [ ] Add input validation to all API endpoints
  - [ ] Use parameterized queries consistently

- [ ] **Database schema fixes**
  - [ ] Make `regular_seasons.coach_id` NOT NULL (currently nullable)
  - [ ] Change `teams.level` to enum type for consistency
  - [ ] Add proper foreign key constraints
  - [ ] Create database migration system

### API Security

- [ ] **Add CSRF protection**
  - [ ] Implement CSRF tokens for all POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints
  - [ ] Configure proper CORS policies
  - [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

- [ ] **Improve error handling**
  - [ ] Remove sensitive information from error messages
  - [ ] Implement centralized error logging
  - [ ] Stop exposing database error codes to users
  - [ ] Remove all `console.log` statements with sensitive data

### Information Security

- [ ] **Fix information disclosure issues**
  - [ ] Remove sensitive logging in `/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` (lines 87-90)
  - [ ] Sanitize error messages before showing to users
  - [ ] Remove database structure exposure in error responses
  - [ ] Implement proper audit logging

## üìä MEDIUM-PRIORITY ISSUES (Priority 3 - 1 week)

### Performance & Scalability

- [ ] **Optimize database queries**
  - [ ] Add database indexes for commonly queried fields
  - [ ] Implement query caching strategy
  - [ ] Reduce number of sequential API calls in components
  - [ ] Add connection pooling configuration

- [ ] **Improve state management**
  - [ ] Consider implementing React Query or SWR for data fetching
  - [ ] Reduce component-level state complexity (53+ useState instances found)
  - [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
  - [ ] Add loading states consistency

### Code Quality

- [ ] **Memory management**
  - [ ] Implement proper cleanup for file uploads
  - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
  - [ ] Stream large file processing instead of loading in memory

- [ ] **Error handling consistency**
  - [ ] Implement global error boundary
  - [ ] Standardize error handling across components
  - [ ] Add proper error recovery mechanisms

## üîß ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS (Priority 4 - Future)

### Security Hardening

- [ ] **Add security headers**
  - [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - [ ] X-Frame-Options
  - [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
  - [ ] Strict-Transport-Security

- [ ] **Session management**
  - [ ] Implement proper session timeout
  - [ ] Add session invalidation on security events
  - [ ] Remove sensitive data from localStorage

### Development Process

- [ ] **Add security tooling**
  - [ ] ESLint security rules
  - [ ] Pre-commit hooks for secret detection
  - [ ] Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
  - [ ] SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**
  - [ ] Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
  - [ ] Security event logging
  - [ ] Error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.)
  - [ ] Database performance monitoring

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **Deployment security**
  - [ ] Environment variable management
  - [ ] Secrets management system
  - [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
  - [ ] Regular security updates process

## üöÄ QUICK WINS (Can be done immediately)

- [ ] **5 minutes:** Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`
- [ ] **10 minutes:** Remove all `console.log` statements with sensitive data
- [ ] **15 minutes:** Add basic file size limits to uploads
- [ ] **30 minutes:** Add basic auth check middleware
- [ ] **1 hour:** Implement input validation on API endpoints

## üìã TESTING REQUIREMENTS

Before production deployment, ensure:

- [ ] **Security testing**
  - [ ] Penetration testing completed
  - [ ] OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities checked
  - [ ] Authentication/authorization testing
  - [ ] Input validation testing

- [ ] **Load testing**  
  - [ ] Database performance under load
  - [ ] File upload stress testing
  - [ ] Concurrent user testing
  - [ ] Memory leak testing

- [ ] **Integration testing**
  - [ ] End-to-end user flows
  - [ ] API endpoint testing
  - [ ] Database transaction testing
  - [ ] Error handling testing

## ‚ö° ENVIRONMENT SETUP

### Production Environment Variables Needed:
```bash
# Database (keep these secret!)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Security
CSRF_SECRET=random_secret_key
SESSION_SECRET=random_session_secret

# File uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=text/csv,application/csv

# Monitoring
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
LOG_LEVEL=warn
```

## üìû IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **STOP** any plans for production deployment until critical issues are fixed
2. **ROTATE** Supabase credentials immediately  
3. **REVIEW** all database access patterns for authorization issues
4. **IMPLEMENT** authentication middleware as first step
5. **TEST** thoroughly after each security fix

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This application currently has serious security vulnerabilities including exposed credentials, authentication bypass opportunities, and potential data access issues. **DO NOT deploy to production** until at least all Priority 1 and Priority 2 issues are resolved.

**Estimated time to production-ready:** 2-3 weeks with dedicated security focus.
