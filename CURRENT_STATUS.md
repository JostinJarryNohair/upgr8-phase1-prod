# Current Project Status

## ✅ What's Working

### Database (Supabase)

- **Coaches Table**: ✅ Created and functional

  - Fields: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `coaching_level`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - Enums: `coaching_level` (initiation, regional, provincial, national, haute-performance)
  - Enums: `role` (coach, directeur-general, directeur-hockey)

- **Camps Table**: ✅ Created and functional
  - Fields: `id`, `coach_id`, `name`, `description`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `location`, `level`, `is_active`, `created_at`
  - Enums: `level` (M13, M15, M18, U7, U9, U11, U13, U15, U18, Junior, Senior)
  - Foreign key relationship to coaches table

### Authentication

## 🔄 What's Partially Working

### Type Safety

- ✅ Database types generated from Supabase
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ⚠️ Some components need type updates to match actual database schema

### Error Handling

- ✅ Basic error handling in place
- ⚠️ Need more comprehensive error states and user feedback

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS TODAY

### Player and Camp Registration System

- ✅ **Tabs UI Working**: Camp detail page now uses shadcn tabs for navigation
- ✅ **Camp Detail Page**: Fully integrated with database, showing Overview and Players tabs
- ✅ **Database Types**: Regenerated and in sync with Supabase
- ✅ **PlayerForm Component**: Ready for integration
- 🔄 **Player Management Components**: Next step is to implement player listing and add player modal
- 🔄 **Camp Registration Workflow**: Next step is to implement registration logic

## 📝 Recent Progress

- Implemented shadcn/ui Tabs component for camp detail navigation
- Refactored camp detail page to use only Overview and Players tabs
- Removed unused and placeholder components
- Ensured all UI is type-safe and database-driven

## Next Steps

- Implement player listing and add player modal in Players tab
- Integrate PlayerForm for adding new players
- Build out camp registration workflow

## ❌ What's Missing

### Database Tables (Creating Today)

- **Players Table**: ✅ Created in Supabase
- **Camp Registrations Table**: ✅ Created in Supabase
- **User Authentication Links**: Need to link coaches to auth.users

### Player Management System

- ⏳ Player profile creation (ready to implement)
- ⏳ Player listing and management (ready to implement)
- ❌ Player invitation system
- ⏳ Camp registration workflow (ready to implement)
- ❌ Email invitation system

### Player Dashboard

- ❌ Player authentication flow
- ❌ Player dashboard layout
- ❌ Camp discovery for players
- ❌ Player registration flow

### Advanced Features

- ❌ File upload system
- ❌ Payment integration
- ❌ Real-time notifications
- ❌ Analytics and reporting
- ❌ Email templates

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Database Schema Alignment

- **Issue**: Some components expect different field names than actual database
- **Impact**: Type errors and potential runtime issues
- **Solution**: Update components to match actual database schema

### 2. Coach Authentication Link

- **Issue**: Coaches table not linked to auth.users
- **Impact**: Authentication system not fully integrated
- **Solution**: Add user_id field to coaches table or create separate auth flow

### 3. Missing Required Fields

- **Issue**: Some components expect fields that don't exist in database
- **Impact**: Form submissions may fail
- **Solution**: Update forms to match actual database schema

## 📋 TODAY'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### ✅ 1. Create Database Tables (COMPLETED)

- [x] Create `create-players-table.sql` script
- [x] Create `create-camp-registrations-table.sql` script
- [x] Execute players table SQL script in Supabase ✅
- [x] Execute camp_registrations table SQL script in Supabase ✅
- [ ] Update database types (`src/types/database.ts`) - will auto-generate
- [ ] Test database schema with sample data

### ✅ 2. Update TypeScript Types (COMPLETED)

- [x] Create `src/types/player.ts`
- [x] Create `src/types/campRegistration.ts`
- [x] Create `src/lib/mappers/playerMapper.ts`
- [x] Regenerate database types to include new tables
- [x] Update temporary types to use generated ones
- [x] Create `src/lib/mappers/campRegistrationMapper.ts`

### 🔄 3. Build Player Management Components (IN PROGRESS)

- [x] Create `src/components/players/PlayerForm.tsx` ✅
- [ ] Create `src/components/players/PlayerList.tsx`
- [ ] Create `src/components/players/AddPlayerModal.tsx`
- [ ] Create `src/components/registrations/CampRegistration.tsx`
- [ ] Add "Add Player" button to camp management (user implementing)

### ⏳ 4. Integrate with Coach Dashboard (READY TO START)

- [ ] Add "Players" tab to camp detail pages
- [ ] Implement player addition to camps
- [ ] Create registration status management
- [ ] Test complete workflow

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Current Status

- **Database**: 2/4 tables created (50%)
- **Authentication**: Fully functional (100%)
- **Coach Dashboard**: Fully functional (100%)
- **Player Management**: 🔄 Preparation complete, implementation ready
- **Deployment**: Ready (100%)

### Target for Today

- **Database**: 4/4 tables created (100%) - after user creates tables
- **Player Management**: Basic functionality (80%) - after tables created
- **Camp Registration**: Working workflow (90%) - after tables created
- **Type Safety**: 100% aligned - after database types regenerate

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### High Priority

1. **Schema Mismatches**: Components expecting different field names
2. **Type Safety**: Some components using `any` types
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across components

### Medium Priority

1. **Performance**: No caching strategy implemented
2. **Security**: Need to implement Row Level Security (RLS)
3. **Testing**: No automated tests

### Low Priority

1. **Documentation**: Need more inline code documentation
2. **Accessibility**: Need to add ARIA labels
3. **Mobile**: Need to optimize for mobile devices
