# Current Project Status

## ✅ What's Working

### Database (Supabase)

- **Coaches Table**: ✅ Created and functional

  - Fields: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `coaching_level`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - Enums: `coaching_level` (initiation, regional, provincial, national, haute-performance)
  - Enums: `role` (coach, directeur-general, directeur-hockey)

- **Camps Table**: ✅ Created and functional
  - Fields: `id`, `coach_id`, `name`, `description`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `location`, `level`, `is_active`, `created_at`
  - Enums: `level` (M13, M15, M18, U7, U9, U11, U13, U15, U18, Junior, Senior)
  - Foreign key relationship to coaches table

### Authentication

- ✅ Supabase Auth integration
- ✅ Login/Register forms implemented
- ✅ Protected routes working
- ✅ Session management functional

### Coach Dashboard

- ✅ Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
- ✅ Camp listing page (`/coach-dashboard/camps`)
- ✅ Camp creation modal with form
- ✅ Individual camp pages (`/coach-dashboard/camps/[id]`)
- ✅ Delete functionality with confirmation modal
- ✅ Edit camp functionality
- ✅ Responsive design

### UI Components

- ✅ DynamicInput and DynamicButton components
- ✅ Modal system for confirmations and forms
- ✅ DashboardLayout with sidebar
- ✅ Red brand color scheme implemented
- ✅ Responsive design patterns

### Deployment

- ✅ Vercel deployment configured and ready
- ✅ Environment variables set up

## 🔄 What's Partially Working

### Type Safety

- ✅ Database types generated from Supabase
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ⚠️ Some components need type updates to match actual database schema

### Error Handling

- ✅ Basic error handling in place
- ⚠️ Need more comprehensive error states and user feedback

## ❌ What's Missing

### Database Tables (Need to Create)

- **Players Table**: Not created yet
- **Camp Registrations Table**: Not created yet
- **User Authentication Links**: Need to link coaches to auth.users

### Player Management System

- ❌ Player profile creation
- ❌ Player listing and management
- ❌ Player invitation system
- ❌ Camp registration workflow
- ❌ Email invitation system

### Player Dashboard

- ❌ Player authentication flow
- ❌ Player dashboard layout
- ❌ Camp discovery for players
- ❌ Player registration flow

### Advanced Features

- ❌ File upload system
- ❌ Payment integration
- ❌ Real-time notifications
- ❌ Analytics and reporting
- ❌ Email templates

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Database Schema Alignment

- **Issue**: Some components expect different field names than actual database
- **Impact**: Type errors and potential runtime issues
- **Solution**: Update components to match actual database schema

### 2. Coach Authentication Link

- **Issue**: Coaches table not linked to auth.users
- **Impact**: Authentication system not fully integrated
- **Solution**: Add user_id field to coaches table or create separate auth flow

### 3. Missing Required Fields

- **Issue**: Some components expect fields that don't exist in database
- **Impact**: Form submissions may fail
- **Solution**: Update forms to match actual database schema

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Fix Database Schema Issues

- [ ] Update camp creation form to match actual database fields
- [ ] Update camp editing form to match actual database fields
- [ ] Fix any type mismatches in components
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations with actual database

### 2. Create Players Table

- [ ] Create players table in Supabase
- [ ] Update database types
- [ ] Create player TypeScript types
- [ ] Test player table creation

### 3. Create Camp Registrations Table

- [ ] Create camp_registrations table in Supabase
- [ ] Update database types
- [ ] Create registration TypeScript types
- [ ] Test registration table creation

### 4. Implement Player Management

- [ ] Create player management components
- [ ] Add player management to coach dashboard
- [ ] Implement player invitation system
- [ ] Test player management workflow

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Current Status

- **Database**: 2/4 tables created (50%)
- **Authentication**: Fully functional (100%)
- **Coach Dashboard**: Fully functional (100%)
- **Player Management**: Not started (0%)
- **Deployment**: Ready (100%)

### Target for Next Phase

- **Database**: 4/4 tables created (100%)
- **Player Management**: Basic functionality (80%)
- **Player Dashboard**: Basic layout (50%)
- **Email System**: Basic invitations (30%)

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### High Priority

1. **Schema Mismatches**: Components expecting different field names
2. **Type Safety**: Some components using `any` types
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across components

### Medium Priority

1. **Performance**: No caching strategy implemented
2. **Security**: Need to implement Row Level Security (RLS)
3. **Testing**: No automated tests

### Low Priority

1. **Documentation**: Need more inline code documentation
2. **Accessibility**: Need to add ARIA labels
3. **Mobile**: Need to optimize for mobile devices
